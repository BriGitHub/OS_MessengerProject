# OS_MessengerProject
This project has a server that allows multiple clients to be able to connect and asynchronously text chat with each other (public group messages and private messages supported).
Private DM messages can also be recieved by offline clients, and these messages are stored in a mailbox until the reciever comes back online to view the messages.

The project runs off Python and uses multithreading.
The GUI runs off Tkinter, a inbuilt python module.
The server runs off ETSU's Einstein platform.
